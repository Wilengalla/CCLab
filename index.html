                The Emotibact is the only bacteria known that can react to human emotions. Its ability to percieve emotions and change its appearance and mannerisms can be seen by how it interacts with different tears that came from various emotions. For example when a tear of joy is placed the bacteria turns into a bright shade of yellow after consuming it. Once it absorbs the drop it start changing, its body moving so rapidly and changes so often it almost looks like a rainbow. All of these aspects will change depending on the kind of tear that is placed onto the dish. The strongest reactions we have seen so far are anger, sadness, and happiness. We will continue to test the diffferent emotions and record our findings
